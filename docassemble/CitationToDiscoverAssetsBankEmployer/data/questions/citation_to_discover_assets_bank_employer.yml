  Collect a judgment from debtor's bank or employer
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Collect a judgment from debtor's bank or employer** Easy Form.

  This program helps you make forms to collect a money you won in a court judgment. If the debtor is refusing to pay, you can ask the court to help you get payment from their bank or employer.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article on [**finding out about a debtor's money, property, and income**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/finding-out-about-debtors-money-property-and-income).

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need to know the:

  * Case number,
  * Name and address of the debtor,
  * Name and address of the debtor's bank or employer,
  * Name and address of the bank or employer's registered agent, if any,
  * Date and amount of judgment, and
  * Amount that remains unpaid.

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 

  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some pages have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

id: about citation
continue button field: about_citation
question: |
  About the citations
subquestion: |
  This program can make two different types of citations:
  
  * A *Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank* tells the debtor's bank to answer questions about the debtor's property and income. 
  * A *Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Employer* tells the debtor's employer to answer questions about the debtor's wages.  

  **Note:** This citation does not apply to the debtor. If you want the debtor to answer questions about their property and income, you can use ILAO's [**Citation to discover assets to debtor Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/123576).
  
  After the bank or employer answers your questions, the court may order bank **{garnishment}** or wage **{garnishment}**.
  
  You will need to serve the bank or employer with the citation. You can use a sheriff or private process server to do this. To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**serving a summons**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/147221).
terms:
  - garnishment: |
      **Garnishment** is when someone's money is taken out of their paycheck or bank account to pay for a debt they owe.

  **Examples of consumer debt**

  A wide variety of debt counts as consumer debt. If your ${judgment_date} judgment was against a person, not a company, it may be a consumer debt judgment. 

  Someone owes you a consumer debt if you lent them money to:

  * Buy something for themself, their family, or their house, or
  * Fix something for themself, their family, or their house.
  
  If the ${judgment_date} judgment came from a case regarding a debt like that, you may need to click **Yes** here.

  If the original judgment said ${other_parties[0].name_full()} owed you $1,000 plus court costs, here's how the amount still owed could be calculated:

  * Original judgment: $1,000
  * Court costs: $90
  * Interest on judgment: $90 (9% of $1,000)
  
  The total amount owed would be $1,000 plus $90 plus $90, which is $1,180.

  If ${other_parties[0].name_full()} had already paid you $300 for that judgment, you would subtract that from the total amount owed. The amount still owed would be $1,180 minus $300, which is $880.
